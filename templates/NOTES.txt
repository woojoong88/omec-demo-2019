This is the instruction to configure your eNodeB to work with ONF M-CORD. You can find architecture illustration in assets/mcord-architecture.png.

1. Check the eNodeB is operating in following information:
    eNodeB Address: {{ .Values.enb.host }}
    eNodeB S1 port: {{ .Values.enb.port }}

2. Configure eNodeB with the correct MME information, get MME IP by following commands:
    export MMEIP=$(kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath="{.status.podIP}" pods mme-0
    export MMEPORT="36412"

    MMEPORT is fixed in templates/mme.yaml.

3. Make sure UE's SIM card information is configured in hss.yaml.

4. Attach UE to M-CORD.
